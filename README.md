# <ins> ****Television Discount Calculator (C Program)</u>**** </ins>


This project is a simple C program that calculates the final payable price of a television after applying the correct discount based on the model selected by the user. It is a beginner-friendly example of how menu-driven programs and conditional statements work in C.

## **Project Overview**

The program allows users to choose between two types of televisions: Colored and Black & White. Colored televisions are available in two sizes (24-inch and 32-inch), while the Black & White category includes a 21-inch model. Each option has a fixed discount rate. After selecting a model and entering its price, the program calculates the discount amount and displays the net price.

### **Features**

Menu-driven interface for selecting TV type and size

Applies predefined discount percentages

Accepts user input for price

Calculates both discount amount and net payable amount

Demonstrates conditional statements and basic arithmetic operations in C

### **Discount Rules**

Colored Television (24-inch): 10% discount

Colored Television (32-inch): 15% discount

Black & White Television (21-inch): 12% discount

### **How the Program Works**

The program displays a menu with two main television categories.

The user selects either Colored or Black & White.

If Colored is selected, the user must also choose between 24-inch and 32-inch models.

The program asks for the price input from the user.

Based on the selected model, the correct discount percentage is applied.

The program calculates the discount amount and the final net price.

The result is displayed clearly on the screen.

Sample Program Output (Text Only)

The output shows the selected model, the discount applied, and the net price to be paid. A typical output includes the user’s choice, the entered price, the discount percentage, and the final calculated amount.

### **Purpose of the Project**

This project is ideal for students learning C programming. It helps in understanding:

Decision-making using conditional statements

User input handling

Simple calculations
  
Structured console-based applications
